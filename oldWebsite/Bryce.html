        <h1>From Pawn to Queen</h1>
        <h3>by Bryce Wilson</h3>
        <br/>
        <h2>The Rules</h2>
        <h4>1. The Peices</h4>
        <h4>2. Check(mate)</h4>
        <h4>3. Castling</h4>
        <h4>4. Draws</h4>
        <h4>5. Other Unimportant Rules</h4>
        <br/>
        <h3>The Pieces</h3>
        <h4>The Pawn</h4>
        <p>The pawn is the smallest piece of the game, however, you get 8 of<br/> them. The pawn can start by either moving 1 space, or 2 spaces.<br/> After it makes its first move, it. When the pawn wants to capture<br/> an opponent peice, it has to move diagonally foward instead of<br/> straight foward. If a pawn makes it to the end of the opponent's<br/> side, it can become a bishop, knight, rook, or even a queen. </p>
        <h4>The Bishop</h4>
        <p>The bishop is one of the most simple pieces to move in the<br/> entire game. They can only move diagnolly. They also capture<br/> the enemy's pieces diagnolly, so they are <br/>very easy to move. You get 2 of them at the beginning of every game,</p>
        <h4>The Knight</h4>
        <p>The knight is worth the same amount as the bishop and you <br/>also get to of them at the beginning, however, the knight<br/> is pretty complex to move. The knight moves in an L<br/> shape. They are important, because they can perform forks, and other basic tactics.</p>
        <h4>The Rook</h4>
        <p>The rook is very similar to the bishop. The rooks start at the<br/> very edges of the board, and move in a straight line<br/> vertically or horizontally, but not diagnolly.<br/> They are alson an important fragment in castling</p>
        <h4>The Queen</h4>
        <p>The queen is the most mobile piece in the game. It is basically<br/> the rook, and the bishop combined. Because of the<br/> queen's power you only get one at the start of the <br/>game. The queen can move vertically, horizontally, and diagonally!</p>
        <h4>The King</h4>
        <p>The queen may be the most mobile piece in the game, but the<br/> King is definitely the most important piece. If the king<br/> is attacked, this is called a check, and you have to <br/>save the king. The way the king moves, is the same as the<br/> Queens, but he can only move 1 square in each direction.<p/>
        <h3>Check(mate)</h3>
        <h4>Check</h4>
        <p>A Check is simply an attack on the king. When the king is in check, or attacked, you must move him to safety. You can also use the acronym C.P.R, or capture, protect, run, to remember. However, if you are put in checked by a knight, you can only use C and R.</p>
        <h4>Checkmate</h4>
        <p>A checkmate is simply a check your king can't escape from. If you can't run, capture, or protect, you are in checkmate, and you lose. A lot of checkmates have names</p>
        <h5>1. Two Rook Mate</h5>
        <h5>2. Queen Mate</h5>
        <h5>3. Rook Mate</h5>
        <h5>4. <a href="https://www.chess.com/chessopedia/view/scholars-mate">Scholar's Mate</a></h5>
        <h5>5. <a href="https://www.chess.com/chessopedia/view/fools-mate ">Fool's Mate</a></h5>
        <h3>Castling</h3>
        <p>Castling is a simple way to get a rook into the game, and move your king to safety. To do it, you have to make sure your king, and the intended rook to not have moved for the whole game, and the space between them is clear. Then, move the king two spaces toward the rook, and have the rook jump over the king</p>
        <h3>
            <ol>
                <li><h4>Stalemate</h4>
                <p>Stalemate is a draw when one side has no legal moves, but is not in check, and is actually a draw</p></li>
            </ol>
            
        </h3>
        <h3>Other unimportant rules</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><h4>En Passant</h4>
            <p>En Passant is a strange rule, where if a pawn advances 2 squars from its starting position, right next to one of your pawns, you are alowed to take the pawn, but instead of going sideways, you go behind the pawn, and it still gets taken.</p></li>
            <li><h4>Pawn Promotion</h4>
            <p>Pawn Promotion is a rule, where when a pawn reaches the end of the board, it can become any other piece(except for the king)</p></li>
        </ol>
        <br/>
        <h2>Tactics</h2>
        <h3>Openings</h3>
        <h4>1.e4 e5</h4>
        <p>Before we get into complex openings. You need to know some algebraic notation. the most common opening moves in algebraic notation are e4, e5. These are the moves King's pawn foward 2 spaces, and black does the same. Bb5 is algebraic notation reffering to moving the bishop to b5. Knight is reffered to as N, King is reffered to as K</p>
        <h4>Queen's Gambit</h4>
        <p>The Queen gambit is an opening which baits your opponent into taking what is a "free pawn, and diverts the pawn from th center."I personally prefer to move the knight in front of his pawn. After you do that,(or don't)Queen's Gabit Accepted 1.d4 d5 2.c4 dxc4</p>
        <h4>Four Knight's Game</h4>
        <p>Four Knight's Game is a simple opening where all four knights move out to the center of the board. 1.e4 45 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Nc3 Nf6.
        <h4>Indian Game</h4>
        1.
        <p>Indian Game is a two move opening where the Queen's Pawn moves out two. Black would then respond with Knight to f6 1.d5 Nf3.</p>
        <h4>Ruy Lopez</h4>
        <p> The Ruy Lopez is probably the oldest Chess opening around. It starts with the basic King's pawn out 2 on both sides. White attacks black's weak pawn with his knight to f6 black defends with his knight. White atack's the defending knight with his bishop, in attempt to win the center pawn. 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5</p>
        <h4>French defense</h4>
        The French defence is an opening favoring white for advanced pawn and center control.
        1.e4 e6
        <h5>Normal variation</h5>
        <p>To make the French Defence Normal Variation, you simply follow up the French Defence with d5 or Queen's paw out two. 1.e4 e6 2.d5 </p>
        <h5>Advance Variation</h5>
        <p>In the Advance Variation. The normal variation is followed by 3.d5 4.e5</p>
        <h5>Exchange Variation</h5>
        It's a variation of the French Defense involving an exchange of center pawns.

        <h4>Pins</h4>
        <p>A pin is a very simple tactic. There are two kind of pins. An absolute, and a </p>
        <h4>Skewers</h4>
        <h4>Discovered Attacks</h4>
        <h4>Forks</h4>
