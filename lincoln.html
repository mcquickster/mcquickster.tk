    <h1>Venty McVentFace</h1>
      <h3>Once apon a spoon, There was a mini man named Venty McVentFace.
        He looked like this:</h3>
      <h1> POOP </h1>                            
<h3>
and every day he went to school he would gain some freinds because he was sooooooooooooooooo warm
  BUT finally he stopped being delousnial and realized that everyone only liked him because they were in antartica and it was as cold as a wooden shovel. So what he did was he stopped being warm (it did kill him but that is a small price to pay to give others mild inconveince) 

      </h3>
      
      <h1>Lean SpleenMcBean</h1>
      <h3>
        Once apon a spoon, there was a human bean named Splean McBean. All of the fellow mean spleens that were in his lean neighborhood called him a greeen machine wich was funny because he was the leanest bean  that could ever drink caffine. But then an unseen teen tried to intervene but the obscene bean said "NO WAY, you are like a figurine in a canteen!" and francene agreed
    <!--This is really funny, u should do more short stories-->
