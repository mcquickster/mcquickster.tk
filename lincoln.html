    <h1>Venty McVentFace</h1>
      <h3>Once apon a spoon, There was a mini man named Venty McVentFace.
        He looked like this:</h3>
      <h1> POOP </h1>                            
<h3>
and every day he went to school he would gain some freinds because he was sooooooooooooooooo warm
  BUT finally he stopped being delousnial and realized that everyone only liked him because they were in antartica and it was as cold as a wooden shovel. So what he did was he stopped being warm (it did kill him but that is a small price to pay to give others mild inconveince) 

      </h3>
      <h3>BUT mini man Venty McVentFace (rest in poop) had a little cold sister named venderetta who actually lived in texas where it was as medium tempature as a picture of a farm so  she went to school where she hoped that people would like being around her and being as cold as a spoon BUT no one did so she died on a table cloth. rest in poop Venty McVentFace
