      <h1> POOP </h1>
      

                                
<h3>
and every day he went to school he would gain some freinds because he was sooooooooooooooooo warm
  BUT finally he stopped being delousnial and realized that everyone only liked him because they were in antartica and it was as cold as a wooden shovel. So what he did was he stopped being warm (it did kill him but that is a small price to pay to give others mild inconveince)
